``jules_rivers.nml``
====================

This file sets the river routing options. It contains two namelists called :nml:lst:`JULES_RIVERS` and :nml:lst:`JULES_OVERBANK`.

River routing introduces two more grids to a JULES run: the river routing input grid and the river routing model grid. The river routing input grid must always be specified as a 2D grid in :nml:lst:`JULES_RIVERS_PROPS`. This is not required to be identical to the input or the model grid. Internally the model compresses this to the river routing model grid, which is a 1D grid with length ``np_rivers``, which is the number of valid routing points in the river routing input grid. All river routing output will be on the river routing model grid, or will be regridded to the model grid.

.. note::
   The river routing code in JULES is still in development. Users should ensure that results are as expected, and provide feedback where deficiencies are identified.


``JULES_RIVERS`` namelist members
---------------------------------

.. nml:namelist:: JULES_RIVERS

.. nml:member:: l_rivers

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for enabling river routing.

   TRUE
       Use the river routing algorithm specified by :nml:mem:`i_river_vn` to route runoff along river pathways.

   FALSE
       No river routing.


.. nml:member:: i_river_vn

   :type: integer
   :default: None

   Switch to select the river routing algorithm to use for river routing.

   ``1``
       Use a UM-coupled JULES implementation of the TRIP model (see Oki et al. 1999). This value is not allowed in standalone JULES

   ``2``
       Use a standalone JULES implementation of the RFM kinematic wave model (see Dadson and Bell 2010, Bell et al. 2007).

   ``3``
       Use a standalone JULES implementation of the TRIP model (see Oki et al. 1999).

.. nml:member:: l_riv_overbank

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for enabling river overbank inundation. Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_RIVERS::l_rivers` is TRUE.

   TRUE
       Calculate frac_fplain_lp, i.e. overbank inundation area as a fraction of gridcell area.

   FALSE
       No overbank inundation calculations

.. note::
   If :nml:mem:`JULES_RIVERS::l_riv_overbank` = FALSE, then optional namelist :nml:lst:`JULES_OVERBANK` is not required.


.. nml:member:: nstep_rivers

   :type: integer
   :permitted: > 0
   :default: None

   The number of model timesteps per routing timestep.

   For example, :nml:mem:`nstep_rivers` = 5 means that runoff will be accumulated for 5 model timesteps before being routed on the 5th timestep.


.. warning::
   The river routing parameter values can be highly dependent on model resolution, so care is required by the user to ensure that appropriate values are selected, tested and adjusted as required.

   Suggested values for global and high-resolution runs are listed below, however these should be treated as a starting point only.


.. nml:group:: RFM parameters - used if :nml:mem:`i_river_vn` = ``2``

   .. nml:member:: a_thresh

      :type: integer
      :default: None
      :suggested: 1 (spatial resolution coarser than 20 km gridcells), ~10 (high-resolution)

      The threshold drainage area (specified in number of cells) draining to a gridbox, above which the grid cell is considered to be a river point (see a_T in Bell et al. 2007:541).
      
      Remaining points are treated as land (drainage area = 0) or sea (drainage area < 0). See Bell et al. (2007).


   .. nml:member:: cland

      :type: real
      :permitted: > 0
      :default: None
      :suggested: 0.20 m/s (global), 0.40 m/s (1 km resolution, Bell et al. 2007)

      The land wave speed (kinematic wave speed for surface flow in a land grid box on the river routing grid, m s\ :sup:`-1`). This is the speed at which water moves through surface soil in a non-river grid cell (even without major rivers, there are always minor water courses so these cells do still contribute flow to neighbouring cells).


   .. nml:member:: criver

      :type: real
      :permitted: > 0
      :default: None
      :suggested: 0.62 m/s (global), 0.50 m/s (1 km resolution, Bell et al. 2007)

      The river wave speed (kinematic wave speed for surface flow in a river grid box on the river routing grid, m s\ :sup:`-1`). This value should be close to the :nml:mem:`rivers_speed` used by TRIP, but not identical because RFM makes different assumptions about e.g. meandering.


   .. nml:member:: cbland

      :type: real
      :permitted: > 0
      :default: None
      :suggested: <= :nml:mem:`cland`. 0.10 m/s (global), 0.05 m/s (1 km resolution, Bell et al. 2007)

      The subsurface land wave speed (kinematic wave speed for subsurface flow in a land grid box on the river routing grid, m s\ :sup:`-1`).


   .. nml:member:: cbriver

      :type: real
      :permitted: > 0
      :default: None
      :suggested: <= :nml:mem:`criver`. 0.15 m/s (global), 0.05 m/s (1 km resolution, Bell et al. 2007)

      The subsurface river wave speed (kinematic wave speed for subsurface flow in a river grid box on the river routing grid, m s\ :sup:`-1`).


   .. nml:member:: retl

      :type: real
      :permitted: -1 to 1
      :default: None
      :suggested: 0.005 (1 km resolution, Bell et al. 2007)

      The (resolution dependent) land return flow fraction. Bell et al. (2007:Table1) suggested value 0.005. On non-river grid cells in the land mask: if retl>0 then fraction retl of the subsurface flow moves to the surface per routing timestep; if retl<0 then fraction retl of the surface flow moves to the subsurface per routing timestep.


   .. nml:member:: retr

      :type: real
      :permitted: -1 to 1
      :default: None
      :suggested: 0.005 (1 km resolution, Bell et al. 2007)

      The (resolution dependent) river return flow fraction. On river grid cells in the land mask: if retr>0 then fraction retr of the subsurface flow moves to the surface per routing timestep; if retr<0 then fraction retr of the surface flow moves to the subsurface per routing timestep.


   .. nml:member:: runoff_factor

      :type: real
      :permitted: > 0
      :default: None

      Values !=1.0 are generally used to correct biases in precipitation when the model is forced with observed data **It is highly recommended that this is set to 1.0 (i.e. no runoff adjustment).**


.. nml:group:: TRIP parameters - used if :nml:mem:`i_river_vn` = ``1,3``

   .. nml:member:: rivers_speed

      :type: real
      :permitted: > 0
      :default: None

      The effective river velocity (m s\ :sup:`-1`). See Oki et al. (1999). :nml:mem:`rivers_speed` should equal (river flow velocity / :nml:mem:`rivers_meander`). A value of 0.4 can be used, while Oki et al. (1999) used a value of 0.5.


   .. nml:member:: rivers_meander

      :type: real
      :permitted: > 0
      :default: None

      The ratio of the actual to calculated river lengths in a river routing gridbox. See Oki et al. (1999). Oki & Sud (1998) called this the Meandering Ratio r_M and suggested an average global value of 1.4.

.. nml:group:: TRIP parameters for UM-TRIP only - i.e. only used if :nml:mem:`i_river_vn` = ``1``

   .. nml:member:: lake_water_conserve_method

      :type: integer
      :default: 1

      Selects different fields for use in water conservation of lake evaporation

      ``1``
          fqw_surft: This is the moisture flux on each tile, in which case the inland water tile is used. Snow sublimation has already been removed from fqw_surft at the point in the code that this is used.

      ``2``
          elake_surft: This is the lake evaporation component of fqw_surft. This avoids the impact that snow melt has on modifying fqw_surft.

   .. nml:member:: trip_globe_shape

      :type: integer
      :default: 2

      The shape of the Earth in the UM-TRIP river routing scheme.

      ``1``
          Spherical: Consistent with other component models (e.g. UM and NEMO) and is better at conserving water when passing water between these other models.

      ``2``
          Ellipsoidal: Closer to the actual shape of the Earth.

``JULES_OVERBANK`` namelist members
-----------------------------------

.. nml:namelist:: JULES_OVERBANK

.. warning::
   The overbank inundation parameter values can be highly dependent on model resolution, so care is required by the user to ensure that appropriate values are selected, tested and adjusted as required.

   Suggested values for global and high-resolution runs are listed below, however these should be treated as a starting point only.

.. nml:member:: l_riv_overbank

   :type: logical
   :default: F

   Switch for enabling river overbank inundation. Only used if :nml:mem:`JULES_RIVERS::l_rivers` is TRUE.

   TRUE
       Calculate overbank inundation area as a fraction of gridcell area.

   FALSE
       No overbank inundation calculations

.. note::
   If :nml:mem:`l_riv_overbank` = FALSE, no further variables are needed from this namelist.

.. nml:member:: overbank_model

   :type: integer
   :permitted: 1, 2, 3
   :default: none

   Choice of model of overbank inundation.

   1. Simple model using an allometric (scaling) relationship to estimate river width, without use of
      topographic data.

   2. Simple model using allometric relationships to estimate river width and depth, and the
      Rosgen (1994) entrenchment ratio, without use of topographic data. When river flow rates are
      higher than the estimated bankfull flow, river width is constrained so that when river
      depth = 2 x bankfull depth then width = :nml:mem:`ent_ratio` * bankfull width.

   3. The inundated area is calculated using a hypsometric integral based on a lognormal area-altitude
      distribution and an allometric relationship to estimate river depth.
      The parameters of the lognormal distribution are specified via :nml:lst:`JULES_OVERBANK_PROPS`.
      (**This is the recommended approach.**)
