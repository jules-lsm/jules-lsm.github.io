JULES version 2.0 Release Notes
===============================

The physical processes and their representation in version 2.0 have not changed from version 1. However, version 2.0 is much more flexible in terms of input and output, and allows JULES to be run on a grid of points. New features include:

* Ability to run on a grid.
* Choice of ASCII or binary formats for input and output files (also limited support of NetCDF input).
* More flexible surface types - number and types can vary.
* Optional time-varying, prescribed vegetation properties.
* More choice of meteorological input variables.
* Optional automatic spin-up.
* Enhanced diagnostics - large choice of variables, frequency of output, sampling frequency, etc.
